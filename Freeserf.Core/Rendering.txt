In freeserf.net the rendering interface is flexible. It is based on the interfaces provides in subdirectory "Render".

The general approach is to create a sprite or triangle for every object and set its Layer property to an existing render layer.

There will be one render layer for each game layer. All these layers must be added to a render view.

To move game objects the only thing to do is to change the X and Y properties of the sprite.
To show or hide an object the property Visible of the sprite is used.

The render view provides a virtual screen which is the render resolution. All render positions are relative to this
virtual screen and independent of the real screen resolution.

For input events that need a position (like mouse clicks) the render view provides the methods "ScreenToView" to
convert screen coordinates to view coordinates.

There is a Silk.net renderer which shows the implementation of a renderer with modern OpenGL and shaders.
