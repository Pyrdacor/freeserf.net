Must-Fix 1.9:

- Approaching serfs at flags should change. Sometimes one path will always win and there might be so much resources, that others have no choice.
- After saving the quit confirm will not ask for saving even if the game progressed a good amount of time
- Leaving the minimap window while dragging with left mouse the minimap is closed (should not happen until mouse release)
- When scrolling Minimap and releasing, the selected area moves so that the wrong area is centered.
- Dragging the minimap will reset the position in most cases
- When the castle is blocked by fighting knights, the transporter will go back to the castle and won't ever come back
- If a flag is full of resources and the transporters too, they won't exchange the resources at the flag and so there is a deadlock.


Rendering:

- Improve grid drawing in minimap?
- There are still some black artifacts sometimes. It seems this is only true for one tile type (grass) and one slope type (a triangle pointing down right).
  It is not affected by zoom or map scrolling so I guess it is a problem with the graphic/shader/index/mask itself. Maybe a mismatch in graphic and mask index.
- Sometimes borders remain from the last game (not deleted properly?)
- In rare cases a flag seems to have the same baseline as an adjacent building. Due to animation baseline change it flickers.
	- This is fixed but remains true for military building white flags
- Saw a stonecutter building with the burning flames behind it.
- Sometimes a serf is drawn that is inside the castle (leaving the castle).
- On/Off button for players are missing when in last game on the spot was no player.
  This happens nearly every time. The visible state is correct though (even of the internal sprite). But nothing is drawn.
- Since switching to Silk.NET some parts are not drawn (especially some building frames and the corner stones).
    - Seems to be related to depth testing (maybe depth buffer is not large enough?).
- Cursor is visible as Silk.NET not supporting hiding it yet


Non-working code:

- Map clicks are not always at the right spot/tile (I guess this is caused by tile heights)
	- This also hinders road building sometimes
- Minimap clicks will result in a map positions that is a bit above the clicked spot
- Possible builds contain not all possible building locations (e.g. for the castle)
- After saving the quit confirm will not ask for saving even if the game progressed a good amount of time
- Dragging the minimap will reset the position in most cases
- Leaving the minimap window while dragging with left mouse the minimap is closed (should not happen until mouse release)
- Click positions in water (no height) are a bit off (this already worked previously!).
- Serfs should not be leaving the stock/castle if there are waiting serfs around the flag
- Wrong sounds are played sometimes
- When loading a game and there is an exception during loading (in AI loading at end) the background intro game seem to be drawn messed up.
  I guess because map and stuff are loaded but then are discarded?


Long AI Games:

- Sometimes no more builders are sent to construction site
- Sometimes no stones are sent to construction site


AI:

Flags / buildings / roads:
- Linking flags should also allow for merging paths
- AIs with much resources build so much buildings at a time that no one is finished in a reasonable time. Maybe limit the number of constructed buildings. This will also relax traffic a bit.
- Building military buildings is either to slow for expansion or not well placed. In any case the territory is too full most of the time and expansion very slow.
- There are too much mines at the same mountain after some time.
- At some territory size the AIs will stop building military buildings and therefore expansion stops
- Mine amount should be limited in relation to food sources. Saw games with dozens of mines but only one fisher. This should not happen.
- Sometimes the AI tries very hard to build something in a non-linkable place and burns it down and rebuilds it forever (e.g. a fisher behind the pond).
- Associated buildings should be well distributed (e.g. each lumberjack should have at least one forester and not one have all).
- Rarely captured buildings are not connected to own road system
- Positions for stocks are not so good any time. It should be far away from other stocks and near some production that needs to store goods in a stock (e.g. weapon, gold bars, tools, planks, food, etc).
- Sometimes additional paths should be built to avoid congestions

Misc:
- Higher characters should be smarter in general than lower characters
- Non-hard-times AIs with low materials should not plan many buildings and then all materials are gone
- Maybe smart AIs should hold enough planks to rebuild a destroyed sawmill and lumberjack.
	- This is only necessary if an enemy is near enough.
- After hard times start the game time is very high so AI decisions depending on game time seem strange then (e.g. building many farms at once).
- Hard time should be also possible in later game (e.g. after losing land). In this case miners could not be available for iron or coal because
  they are used for gold or stone mines. This must be considered then and maybe those mines should be demolished to free miners.
- The check stone and gather stone radius of stonecutters should be equal so that stonecutters who won't gather anymore stone should be demolished immediately (this is crucial in hard times).

Mining / finding minerals:
- Finding minerals and mine spots is not good yet. The search spots should change from time to time but changing doesn't mean putting hundreds of flags at the same mountain.
- In hard times the search for mountains should be better (look specific for coal and iron spots).
- Flags for geologists are too far away from mountains.
- Remove mines from AIStateBuildBuilding as AIStateFindMinerals handles them.
- Sometimes there are way too many geologist out there. This also causes traffic. It seems that every single hammer is used to train a geologist.

Finish attacking logic!


Performance:

- While debugging the game pauses from time to time (more game time = longer and more pauses). The game is unplayable very quick.
- There seem to be issues with progressed games and many serfs/buildings. Some performance tests are necessary.


Logic:

- A transporter first walks to the last flag and then goes back to the beginning of the road to go to idle mode.
  - I think in original game the transporter went straight to idle mode when he was at the right location.
  - Is this maybe caused by wrong road building direction? This is often seen in AIs. Maybe the linking of roads is reversed there?!
- Geologists give up too fast.
- Once a freewalking lumberjack blocks a road and stand there waiting. Also seen a forester. He was not even on the road but tried to walk towards it. The transporter on the road
  was also blocked by this.
- Sometimes there is a deadlock of walking serfs. Saw a digger and a transporter that were waiting at each other but could just switch positions.
  - In debug there were two diggers (one with state WaitIdleOnPath and one with Walking). A digger should never have WaitIdleOnPath I think as this is for transporters only!
  - Also seen a transporter or generic serf which waits for another generic serf which flickers and changes directions like crazy. This crazy serf is on top of an idle serf.
- Sometimes construction materials are not moved out of the castle. The construction site gets no resources. After demolishing/rebuilding it works again. The knight stayed there forever.
  This also happens if the building was already built a bit. And it seems to happen quite often lately.
  - Since a change in update logic this seem to be fixed. Further testing needed.
  - Sometimes resources are no longer delivered to a construction site even if there are enough in the castle
	- I guess this happens when the emergency program gets active at a specific time.
	- The workaround was building.RemoveRequestedMaterials(); in Player.UpdateEmergencyProgram. But this can lead to an exception in Building.RequestedResourceDelivered.
- Seen a knight that was turning left and right on the same map spot (either it was only a display bug or a logic bug). It was after capturing a building.


Notification Box:

Bad display of text/image.
Test again because font char gaps should be smaller now!

- Text too long for:
	FoundStone
    MineEmpty
    OneHourSinceSave
    UnderAttack
- Chaos for:
    LostBuildings


Missing stuff:

- multiplayer
	- multiplayer should support coop mode (one player is played by two or more clients)
- button to merge roads to a flag
- ground analysis for local spectators?
- possible builds for local spectators?
- disable some features in multiplayer (e.g. game speed)


Nice to have:

- After closing a game the GameInitBox should display the last started game settings.
  This way a map can be played again or the RNG number can be memorized.
- The list of savegames should also allow subdirs with savegames in them. But then there must be a possibility to go up and down the directory hierarchy.
- Custom games and AIvsAI should share the map size setting.
- When switching player in AIvsAI (e.g. with key 'j') the open menu should be updated.
- Later avoid the tactic to demolish a hut when own knights lose and the opponent is capturing it.


TODO:

- Check/improve map position selection (clicks, minimap clicks, centering)
- Finish AIs
- Add more game options (like tutorial)
- Improve/fix sound and add music/sound players for all operating systems
- Look through all TODO code comments and resolve them
- Bugfixing (important is the serf logic which seems to be very bugged in some situations)
- Remove unused code and improve bad code
- Adjust and limit all values properly (like max speed increase and so on)
- Check if all shortcuts/keystrokes work as expected (if not implement them)
- Add new features / improve usability (more infos in UI, better menus, indicators like "how many trees are left for a lumberjack" or even a visual search area if the building is selected, get materials after demolishing)
- Localization (texts should be of the right language later)
- Rework whole serf, flag and path logic. Flag searches should be eased by the stored road instances of each flag.
- Feature to record a game and replay/watch it (like watching an AIvsAI game)
- End game screens, Intro, Outro, etc
	- AI players and other human players should be able to surrender
	- Missions should have targets to reach to get the win (e.g. less than x enemy buildings left, etc)


Really smart AIs should:

- Consider nearby enemies or closest enemy direction
- Consider mountains / water as natural defending shields
- Consider waiting till humans have placed their castle to avoid being crushed by a nearby placed castle
	- Either wait to build own castle
	- Or wait to build buildings inside territory
- Put more thoughts into
	- Finding attack targets
	- Adjusting settings
	- Place buildings
	- etc


Exceptions:

- When a knight wins a fight there is often a bad torso sprite index
- If not debugging there is sometimes an exception in PopupBox.DrawResourceDirectionBox ("Not a knight among the castle defenders.")
  - Not seen for a long time. Maybe only when setting the castle knights manually?
- Target array is too small
- Delivered unexpected resource
- KeyNotFoundException (maybe when knights fight)
